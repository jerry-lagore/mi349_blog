            <p>The alarm goes off at 8:45am. It’s a Thursday and it is time for me to get up for work. Luckily, I work remotely, and my first meeting is not till 9:15. My morning routine follows – not very interesting so I’ll spare you guys the details. I am at my desk booting up my super slow work-issued ThinkPad and have to connect to the Global VPN before I can join my meeting. I join the “Daily Stand Up” as they call it and give my daily status. After that, it’s time to test software to make sure bugs/glitches have been fixed and documented. Without delving too far, I am a Quality Assurance intern for a very large pizza company based in Detroit. I do this until 4pm, with meetings sprinkled in here and there. After work, it is time to work on classes. Thursdays and Fridays I have no class, so I just work on assignments or get ahead. By evening time, I have figured out what festivities my roommates and friends are getting up to for the night and joining them. Overall the day is pretty slow and spent behind a computer screen for most, but I can’t really complain all too much.</p>
