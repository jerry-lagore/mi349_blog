            <h2>A day in the life of an MSU student</h2>

            <p>The alarm goes off at 8:45am. It’s a Thursday and it is time for me to get up for work. Luckily, I work remotely, and my first meeting is not till 9:15. My morning routine follows – not very interesting so I’ll spare you guys the details. I am at my desk booting up my super slow work-issued ThinkPad and have to connect to the Global VPN before I can join my meeting. I join the “Daily Stand Up” as they call it and give my daily status. After that, it’s time to test software to make sure bugs/glitches have been fixed and documented. Without delving too far, I am a Quality Assurance intern for a very large pizza company based in Detroit. I do this until 4pm, with meetings sprinkled in here and there. After work, it is time to get ahead on classes. Thursdays and Fridays I have no class, so I just work on assignments. By evening time, I have figured out what festivities my roommates and friends are getting up to for the night and join them. Overall the day is pretty slow and spent behind a computer screen for most of it, but I can’t really complain all too much.</p>

            <h2>Mel Tucker - MSU's saving grace?</h2>

            <p>As of writing this, the Michigan State Spartans football team is undefeated at 6-0 and has a bowl game locked in for their second season under a new coach. Going into the season, most thought (and bet) that the Spartans would only win 4 or 5 games after their 2-5 performance in 2020. Who is the man leading and coaching this team? Mel Tucker has so far impressed many and brought with him a breath of fresh air to the program. His best accomplishments this season have been defeating 2 Big Ten teams on the road, while also crushing a ranked Miami down in Florida. The Spartans are having fun but the true test lies ahead. The upcoming weeks have a ranked Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State to deal with. Of course, we can’t not recognize the rest of the coaching staff and the players themselves for executing the plays. The bottom line is that Michigan State football has a pulse again and is on the prowl. Many point out that Tucker’s best tool is his excellent use of the transfer portal. Most of the star players were under celebrated kids that the Spartans swooped up and gave a second chance. Let’s not get too ahead of ourselves though, the road is still long and weary.</p>
